# NewRocket Portal App

The purpose of this app is to build out a page based on a mock up using valid HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript through mostly
Bootstrap 3 and Angular.js and making sure it is responsive on different viewports.

## Instructions to run the app

### Make sure you have these Dependencies 
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) within the terminal and then install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in ther terminal next.

### Install Git

You can download and install Git from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download). Once installed, you should have access to the git command line tool. The main commands that you will need to use are:

- git clone ...: Clone a remote repository onto your local machine.
- git checkout ...: Check out a particular branch or a tagged version of the code to hack on.


### Downloading the repository:

In ther terminal run this command in a directory that you want this project to ho in
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/adclleva/NewRocket_Portal_App.git
```

## Running the application

Make sure you go to the directory where the NewRocket_Portal_App is located in the command line.
``` bash
cd NewRocket_Portal_App
```

Then once inside the directory, you go into the app directory through the command line.
``` bash
cd app
```

Next, if you have npm and http-server installed globally in your machine, you'll be able to run a command-line http server to run the application locally. Run this line in the command line to have it run.
``` bash
http-server -o
```

Then it will automatically open your preffered browser and the AngularJS app is running!
Please look at it's responsiveness and let me know what improvements to make! :)
